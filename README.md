## 🧙‍♂️ Our Experience

### 🎒 Our Journey and Inspiration
The Round Table was born out of necessity and fueled by passion. As a solo full-stack developer with a deep-rooted love for D&D, I've always wanted to make the experience as seamless and engaging as possible.

### 🎯 The Origin Story
The pivotal moment came when one of our close friends moved away. We soon realized that online sessions, despite being the only viable option, lacked the fluidity and depth we were accustomed to in our in-person adventures. It didn't take long to understand: there had to be a better way.

### 👨‍💻 The Development Process
That's when I decided to take the plunge. I embarked on this ambitious project to build an all-encompassing platform for D&D aficionados like ourselves. I poured countless hours into creating an application that doesn't just replace the tabletop but enhances it. The goal? To mimic the feel of real-life sessions as closely as possible and add layers of interactivity and immersion that weren't feasible before.

### 💞 A Community Endeavor
While I've been steering the ship in terms of development, I've had unwavering support from my circle of D&D enthusiasts. They've been closely involved in the conceptualization and iterative testing phases, providing invaluable feedback to make sure The Round Table meets our high standards and expectations.

### 🚀 What's Next?
Currently, the platform is being fine-tuned based on our personal use-cases. However, the vision doesn't stop here. Once the game components have been finalized and rigorously tested, The Round Table will be opened up for the broader D&D community to use and enjoy.

###  🧝‍♀️🧚‍♂️🧛‍♂️🧜‍♀️Meet the Party
For those curious about the adventurers putting this platform to the test, let me introduce our homebrew campaign's valiant party members:

Stigander: That's me! I play a nature domain cleric, a snowy white owl focused on spreading good vibes, peace, and love for mushrooms and nature.

Bojack: A dark elf monk grappling with inner demons but striving for enlightenment one step at a time.

Zaris: Don't let his whimsical demeanor fool you; our dark elf rogue is a master of daggers and subterfuge.

Malarie: Our fearless barbarian with a penchant for chaos, causing all sorts of trouble for foes unlucky enough to cross our path.

By using The Round Table, we've managed to bring our characters and adventures to life like never before, all while setting a new standard for online D&D gameplay.
